# A dumb 2fa extension
Why? Because why not. Also I get tired of having to reach for my phone every time.

# Things that are planned (or have been done)
* Sync between phones somehow.
* Encrypt keys using browser password manager.
* Fancy thing to let you print off paper backups of 2FA tokens.
* Support for multiple formats(EG: Standard, and Steam).
* Maybe more..

# Does it pose a security issue?
Nope, if someone has access to your computer, you're fucked one way or the other.

# License
zlib or do whatever you want idgaf.

# Professionalism?
No time for that, must code and be a clown :clown:
(Maybe one day though, this is a personal project for now, if people show interest,
I may clean up this readme)
